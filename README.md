# Simon-Game

It is a game where are just only four buttons

One random button from them will be flicked one by one and user have to remember that in order

When a single button flicks user have to input all the flicked button from starting to the last flicked button in the right order

If user enters a wrong input then the game will be lost and restarted.

The score will be maintained until the user enters right order of input.

It's just a fun little game made in **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
